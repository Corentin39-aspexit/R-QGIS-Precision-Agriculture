{"ALG_DESC": "Allows to calculate a zoning quality indicator in relation to available auxiliary information. The indicator should fill in the zoning vector layer, and the vector layer to which the zoning is to be compared. Several indices are available. Make sure that the zoning and underlying points have the same projection. If the zoning comes from a previous zoning algorithm, make sure that the zoning has been saved and is not a temporary layer",
