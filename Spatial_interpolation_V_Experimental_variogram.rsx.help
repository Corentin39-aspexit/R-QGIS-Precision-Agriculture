{"ALG_DESC": "Generates an experimental variogram from a user-selected numeric field (column) in a vector layer. The user can choose the maximum distance up to which the experimental variogram is constructed, and the distance step (lag) for which the semi-variance is calculated. The vector layer must be projected !",
