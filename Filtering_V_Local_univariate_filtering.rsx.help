 "Filtering_method":"(1) CV : Coefficient of variation (inspired from Spekken et al. (2013). A simple method for filtering spatial data \n (2) IDW : Each point value (Zi) is compared to interpolated value from neighbours (Zj). If Zi is outside the range Zj+/- n standard deviations of neighbourood values, the point is considered an outlier (inspired from Simbahan et al., 2004 : Screening yield monitor data improves grain yield maps) \n (3) Moran : remove outliers based on Moran spatial autocorrelation statistics (inspired from Gozdowski et al., 2010 â€“ Evaluation of methods for the detection of spatial outliers in the yield data of winter wheat) \n (4) Normal : outliers removal assuming normal distribution in the data",

 "Max_distance_neighbours":"For the Moran method only",
 "Outliers_handling":"whether outliers are marked or removed",
