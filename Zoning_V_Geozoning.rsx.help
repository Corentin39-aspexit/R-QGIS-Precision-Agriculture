{"ALG_DESC": "Allows to generate a zoning based on the R geozoning package (inspired from Loisel et al. 2019 â€“ An optimisation-based approach to generate interpretable within-field zones",
 "ALG_CREATOR": "LEROUX Corentin", "ALG_HELP_CREATOR": "LEROUX Corentin",
 "Vector_input":"Input point layer",
 "Step":"Related to the iterations of the algorithms. The higher the step parameter, the longer the computation time ; but the algorithm might find better zonings",
 "Threshold":"Minimal difference in value between zones"
