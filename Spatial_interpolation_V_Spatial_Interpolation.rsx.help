{"ALG_DESC": "Generates the interpolation of a user-defined numeric field (column) of a vector layer. A raster is generated. The user can choose the size of the interpolation grid and the interpolation method. ",
 "ALG_CREATOR": "LEROUX Corentin", "ALG_HELP_CREATOR": "LEROUX Corentin",
 "Vector_input":"Input point layer",
 "Contour":"Contour of the field",
 "Method":" (1) Inverse distance weighting: the user can choose a slightly finer weighting method (inverse, exponential, ...), and choose the interpolation power. \n (2) Point kriging: the user fills in a theoretical variogram model. The interpolation map is accompanied by a kriging variance map (interpolation uncertainty). \n (3) Block kriging : the user enters a theoretical variogram model. The interpolation map is accompanied by a kriging variance map (interpolation uncertainty).",

 "Variogram model": "(for point and block kriging method only)",
 "Max_dist_vario" : "maximum distance up to which the experimental variogram is constructed",
 "Lag" : "distance step for which the semi-variance is calculated",
 "Interpolation_map":"Final raster after interpolation of the data"}
